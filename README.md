# GUI Tool Kit  
## For Multiple Optimization Algorithms  
---
## Description  
---

&emsp;&emsp;A python based tool-kit for extracting results for different fitness functions with different optimization algorithms.  
Which provide the comparative study of these algorithms for suitable optimization method selection for different functions.

1. This project currently is having analysis of 10 Functions their Convergance graph being plotted via matplotlib in examples section.  

2. Project Structure Of Each Function.
